# Stella, an easy using and beautiful blog theme based on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

### With Gatsby

1. **Install Gatsby cli.**

using npm

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

or using yarn

```shell
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using stella
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/jctaoo/stella
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd my-blog/
# yarn
yarn start 
# npm
npm run start
```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment
with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in
the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Open the `my-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and
the browser will update in real time!

### Without Gatsby

Just clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jctaoo/stella my-blog
```
The way to start and developing is same as "With Gatsby".
